  "About_title": "What happens when we listen to music?",
  "About_content_1": "When we listen to music, there is a \"musical communication\" achieved from the musician to the listener that is mainly emotional. In fact, emotion is one of the principal reasons to listen to music. This communication begins with the expression of an emotion by the performer or composer, which can be perceived by a listener and perhaps arouse a particular emotion. The listener can then regard the music as aesthetically valuable and finally like it.",
  "About_content_2": "However, this perspective is debatable, since perception and induction of emotions can operate in parallel (i.e., happy music can induce melancholy or sad music can induce excitement). Moreover, it can be fairly difficult to listeners to understand the difference between emotion perception and induction in music. Our goal is to explain this distinction so that we can eventually implement new technologies with different applications: personalization of music recommendation and music therapy. The reason to focus on the perception of emotions is mainly twofold: it is relatively less influenced by situational factors (environment, mood, etc.) and listeners are generally consistent in their ratings. Nonetheless, there is a need to continue to understand the reliability of perceptual emotional ratings, which will be one of the main goals of our research.",
  "About_content_3": "As a first exercise, can you distinguish the emotion that the baby expresses in the following image?",
  "About_content_4": "Do you perceive that the baby is expressing sadness? While the expression and perception of sadness can be very general and universal in this case, the induced emotion that this image produces can be varied, maybe tenderness when you see your baby crying or fear of not knowing why s/he cries.",
  "About_content_5": "Regarding music, when we ask people to rate the emotions they perceive in music, it is very likely that when they listen to a musical piece and rate a piece as sad confounding perception with induction. This becomes evident when we ask people to explain their ratings, e.g., “it makes me feel without energy” or “it reminds me of my father that passed away recently”.",
  "About_content_6": "Can you use the example of the baby to look at the following video? Do you think that the music express happiness, anger, sadness, and tenderness?",
  "About_content_7": "While we try to analyze our emotional perception and induction in music, we can also use technology to attempt to model our perception. In the bottom line, our algorithms can only be as good as our own agreement.",
